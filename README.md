# Coldest Night
Coldest Night is a stealth game being developed in
[Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org). The game is in a prototype stage and
may not represent its final quality. Significant changes may occur between
versions.

# Running
Pre-built demo versions of the game can be found on the
[GitHub releases page](https://github.com/krobbi/coldest-night/releases) and on
[itch.io](https://krobbizoid.itch.io/coldest-night). The Godot Engine project
source is located in the root direcory of this repository.

Running the game will create directories and files in a
`krobbizoid/coldest-night/` directory alongside the Godot Engine editor
data/settings folder (in `%AppData%` on Windows.)

# Building
See [etc/builds/README.md](/etc/builds/README.md) for detailed instructions on
building the game.

# Known Issues
You may encounter the following issues when running the game:

## Issues Affecting All Platforms
* The format version of save files will only change between public builds,
which may result in corrupted save files from running development versions.
* Using a high DPI display may cause issues as compatibility with high DPI
displays has not been tested.
* Controller buttons cannot be mapped to controls in versions `0.7.0` and below
unless they have an analog pressure input.

## Issues Affecting Windows
* Using an audio playback format with a sample rate other than 44100 Hz may
cause game audio to be distorted.

## Issues Affecting macOS
* The macOS app is not notarized and you may need to bypass security settings
in order to run it.
* The native macOS icon from versions `0.3.0` and below is poorly formatted and
may cause a crash when running the game.
* There is no native macOS icon between versions `0.4.0` and `0.6.0`.
