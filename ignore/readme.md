# Ignore Directory
The `ignore/` directory is intended for developers to store notes and other
resources without being tracked by Godot Engine or by version control. Do not
delete or modify this file, or the `.gdignore` file in this directory.

The `.gdignore` file tells Godot Engine to not import any resources from this
directory or its subdirectories, and to hide the directory in the Godot Engine
editor.
